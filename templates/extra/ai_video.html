                        <h2>Veed.io</h2>
                        <p>Pros: They ask you a few questions for data purposes, but it’s still easy to sign up and
                            navigate through the website. Video creation is super fast and it even gives you
                            auto-generated subtitles. I liked the way that it allows you to add some animations,
                            media files before the final output. The voice and the story was perfect. Just listening
                            to the audio of the output, you feel like one of many trendy reels on Tiktok or
                            Instagram is being played. My first video was about Sumo stars playing football and it
                            generated a well-organized speech on the video. The second one was about Messi’s
                            retirement interview and the output was an AI-generated speech on behalf of Messi,
                            but with no emotion.
                            <br><br>

                           Cons: I feel they lack data or it’s difficult for the program to find and use proper people and
                            objects. The content of the video did not match with my prompt that well. It did not find me
                            realistic media, but rather animational ones. Also, there was a mismatch between the video and
                            the story being told. There were some video clips related to the topic, but they had nothing
                            to do with the speech.
                            <br><br>
                            Conclusion. Overall, I believe there is some type of template in the system that randomly picks
                            short video clips that are relevant to the topic. It generates a pretty decent speech on the
                            topic and then combines the two products. I guess finding the way to connect them properly and
                            the usage of real characters would take the industry to the next level. I’ve seen those videos
                            on deep-faking, however, creating a video that has real characters talking from scratch has a
                            long way to go.

                        <p>Pros: Easy to sign-up. It offers templates for various topics and you can also create your own one.
                            They consider the audience and the participants/materials in the video as they ask questions about them.
                            <br> <br>
                            Cons: It’d be better to ask more about the content of the video you want such as the actions you want to be performed or
                            anything you want the characters to say. Stuck when generating the video and it never finished.
                            I tried it once more and it failed to finish generating the video again.
